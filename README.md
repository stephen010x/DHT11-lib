# DHT11-lib

Arduino library for the DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor. Created by Stephen Harris.

This library was created for a class project at Utah Tech University.

## How to Install

1) Compress the files within `DHT11_lib/` to a zip file named `DHT11_lib.zip`

2) In the *Arduino* IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include *Library* > Add .ZIP *Library*.

3) From Arduino's file explorer, navigate to the location of `DHT11_lib.zip` and open it. From there the library should be accessible from your Arduino sketch.
